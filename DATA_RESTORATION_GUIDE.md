# DATA RESTORATION GUIDE
**Created:** October 31, 2025
**Purpose:** Restore all lost data after October 25th rollback

---

## WHAT HAPPENED

Your code was rolled back to October 25th version, but the database was NOT rolled back. This means:
- ‚ùå User profile data may be incomplete or missing
- ‚ùå Society data may be incomplete
- ‚ùå Some users may have lost handicaps, home courses, society memberships
- ‚ùå Your personal data (Pete Park) needs restoration

---

## WHAT WE'RE RESTORING

Based on the SQL files in your `/sql` folder, I've found backup data for:

1. **Pete Park** (YOU)
   - LINE ID: U2b6d976f19bca4b2f4374ae0e10ed873
   - Username: 007
   - Handicap: 2
   - Home Course: Pattaya CC Golf
   - Society: Travellers Rest Golf Group

2. **Travellers Rest Golf Group (TRGG)**
   - Organizer profile
   - Society profile
   - Logo and website info

3. **Database Schema**
   - user_profiles
   - society_profiles
   - society_members linkage

---

## STEP-BY-STEP RESTORATION

### STEP 1: CHECK CURRENT STATE

1. Go to Supabase SQL Editor:
   ```
   https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/pyeeplwsnupmhgbguwqs/editor
   ```

2. Open this file and copy ALL contents:
   ```
   C:\Users\pete\Documents\MciPro\sql\DIAGNOSTIC_CHECK_ALL_DATA.sql
   ```

3. Paste into Supabase SQL Editor and click **RUN**

4. Review the output:
   - How many user profiles exist?
   - Are names missing?
   - Is your profile (Pete Park) correct?
   - Are societies missing?
   - Do you see any data at all?

5. **IMPORTANT:** Take screenshots or copy the results for comparison later

---

### STEP 2: RESTORE ALL DATA

1. Open this file in a text editor:
   ```
   C:\Users\pete\Documents\MciPro\sql\MASTER_DATA_RESTORATION.sql
   ```

2. **REVIEW SECTION 5** - "RESTORE OTHER KNOWN USERS"
   - This section has a template for adding more users
   - If you know other users' data (names, LINE IDs, handicaps), uncomment and fill in
   - If not, we'll add them later as you identify them

3. Copy the ENTIRE contents of `MASTER_DATA_RESTORATION.sql`

4. Paste into Supabase SQL Editor

5. Click **RUN**

6. Watch for success messages in the output:
   - ‚úÖ Pete Park restored
   - ‚úÖ TRGG organizer restored
   - ‚úÖ Society profiles created
   - ‚úÖ Verification queries run

7. Check the verification output at the bottom:
   - Does Pete Park show correct data?
   - Do societies appear?
   - Are there any error messages?

---

### STEP 3: VERIFY IN APPLICATION

1. Open your application: `https://mycaddipro.com`

2. Log in as Pete Park (LINE login)

3. Check your profile:
   - Name: Pete Park ‚úÖ
   - Username: 007 ‚úÖ
   - Handicap: 2 ‚úÖ
   - Home Course: Pattaya CC Golf ‚úÖ
   - Society: Travellers Rest Golf Group ‚úÖ

4. Check Society Dashboard:
   - Go to Society Organizer view
   - Should see "Travellers Rest Golf Group" ‚úÖ
   - Logo should display ‚úÖ

5. Test creating an event or browsing events

---

### STEP 4: IDENTIFY MISSING USERS

After restoration, if you notice users are still missing:

1. Ask them to log in once to create their LINE user entry

2. Once they log in, run this query in Supabase to see their data:
   ```sql
   SELECT line_user_id, name, email, role, home_course_name, society_name
   FROM user_profiles
   WHERE name ILIKE '%their name%';
   ```

3. If their data is incomplete, add a new section to `MASTER_DATA_RESTORATION.sql` following the template in SECTION 5

4. Re-run the restoration script

## FILES CREATED FOR YOU

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `sql/DIAGNOSTIC_CHECK_ALL_DATA.sql` | Check current database state |
| `sql/MASTER_DATA_RESTORATION.sql` | Restore all known data |
| `DATA_RESTORATION_GUIDE.md` | This guide |

## WHAT DATA IS CURRENTLY RESTORED

### User Profiles:
- ‚úÖ Pete Park (Handicap 2, Username 007, TRGG member)

### Societies:
- ‚úÖ Travellers Rest Golf Group (TRGG)
- ‚úÖ Ora Ora Golf (if exists)

### Society Memberships:
- ‚úÖ Pete Park ‚Üí TRGG (Primary society)

### What's NOT restored yet:
- ‚ùå Other users (need to identify them from diagnostic check)
- ‚ùå Event registrations (if any were lost)
- ‚ùå Round history (if any were lost)
- ‚ùå Other society members

---

## HOW TO ADD MORE USERS

If you identify more users who need restoration:

1. Find their data from:
   - Old screenshots
   - Previous SQL files in `/sql` folder
   - Your memory of their profile details
   - Ask them directly

2. Edit `MASTER_DATA_RESTORATION.sql` SECTION 5

3. Copy this template and fill in their details:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO user_profiles (
       line_user_id, name, email, role, home_club, home_course_name, society_name, profile_data, created_at, updated_at
   )
   VALUES (
       'U__THEIR_LINE_ID__',  -- Get this from diagnostic check or ask them to log in
       'User Name',
       'email@example.com',
       'golfer',
       'Their Home Club',
       'Their Home Course',
       'Their Society Name',
       jsonb_build_object(
           'personalInfo', jsonb_build_object('firstName', 'First', 'lastName', 'Last'),
           'golfInfo', jsonb_build_object('handicap', '10', 'homeClub', 'Club Name')
       ),
       NOW(),
       NOW()
   )
   ON CONFLICT (line_user_id) DO UPDATE
   SET
       name = EXCLUDED.name,
       home_club = EXCLUDED.home_club,
       home_course_name = EXCLUDED.home_course_name,
       society_name = EXCLUDED.society_name,
       profile_data = EXCLUDED.profile_data,
       updated_at = NOW();
   ```

4. Re-run the entire `MASTER_DATA_RESTORATION.sql` script

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: "Pete Park data is still not 100%"

**Solution:** Check which specific fields are missing:
```sql
SELECT
    line_user_id,
    name,
    username,
    home_course_name,
    society_name,
    profile_data
FROM user_profiles
WHERE line_user_id = 'U2b6d976f19bca4b2f4374ae0e10ed873';
```

Then manually update the missing fields in the restoration script.

---

### Problem: "Other users are missing"

**Solution:**
1. Run diagnostic check to see who exists
2. Get list of expected users (from memory, old screenshots, etc.)
3. Compare and identify missing ones
4. Add them to SECTION 5 of restoration script

---

### Problem: "Societies don't show up in dashboard"

**Solution:** Check both tables:
```sql
-- Check user_profiles
SELECT * FROM user_profiles WHERE role = 'organizer';

-- Check society_profiles
SELECT * FROM society_profiles;
```

If missing, re-run restoration script. If still broken, check RLS policies:
```sql
-- Check if RLS is blocking access
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'society_profiles';
```

---

### Problem: "Data keeps getting lost again"

**Solution:** This means the application code is overwriting the database. Check:
1. Is the old code (from Oct 25 rollback) still running?
2. Is there a migration script running on app startup?
3. Are user logins triggering profile overwrites?

Fix by updating the code to match the database schema.

---

## IMPORTANT NOTES

1. **Run diagnostic FIRST** - Always check current state before restoring

2. **Transaction safety** - The restoration script uses BEGIN/COMMIT, so if anything fails, nothing changes

3. **Idempotent** - You can run the restoration script multiple times safely (uses ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE)

4. **Incremental** - You don't need all user data at once. Start with Pete, verify it works, then add others

5. **Backups** - This restoration script IS your backup. Keep it safe!

---

## NEXT STEPS AFTER RESTORATION

Once data is restored:

1. ‚úÖ Test all user workflows (login, profile, events, scoring)
2. ‚úÖ Ask other users to log in and verify their data
3. ‚úÖ Commit the restoration scripts to git for future reference
4. ‚úÖ Update application code to prevent data loss in future
5. ‚úÖ Consider adding database backups (Supabase has automatic backups)

---

## CONTACT FOR HELP

If you encounter issues:

1. Check Supabase logs: `https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/pyeeplwsnupmhgbguwqs/logs`
2. Run verification queries from restoration script
3. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
4. Review RLS policies if data appears but isn't accessible
