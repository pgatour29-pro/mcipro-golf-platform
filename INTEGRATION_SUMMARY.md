## Files Modified

   - CSS added: Lines 1097-1242
   - HTML replaced: Manager Analytics tab content
   - JavaScript added: Before closing `</body>` tag

---

## Conflicts Resolved

### 1. CSS Namespace Conflicts
**Solution:** All GM Dashboard CSS prefixed with `#manager-analytics .gm-dashboard`

### 2. JavaScript Scope Conflicts
**Solution:** Wrapped all GM Dashboard JS in IIFE: `(function() { ... })()`

### 3. Animation Name Conflicts
**Solution:** Renamed animations:
- `float` → `gm-float`
- `pulse` → `gm-pulse`
- All others kept unique

### 4. Duplicate JavaScript
**Issue:** Script initially inserted before both `</body>` tags (one in template string, one real)
**Solution:** Removed duplicate, kept only the one before actual `</body>` tag
