       // ... other settings
   };
   localStorage.setItem('golf_course_settings', JSON.stringify(courseSettings));
   ```

3. **Without API Key:**
   - System automatically uses demo mode

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Tabs Not Showing
1. Hard refresh: **Ctrl+Shift+R** (Windows) or **Cmd+Shift+R** (Mac)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Wait 5 minutes for Netlify deployment
4. Check browser console for errors

### Weather Not Loading
1. Check if API key is configured in settings
2. If no API key, demo mode should activate automatically
3. Check console: `[WeatherIntegration] Using demo weather data`
4. Verify OpenWeatherMap API is accessible
5. Check API key quota (free tier: 60 calls/minute, 1M calls/month)

### Maintenance Data Not Saving
1. Check localStorage is enabled in browser
2. Open DevTools → Application → Local Storage
3. Look for key: `mcipro_maintenance_data`
4. If blocked, check browser privacy settings

### Console Errors to Look For
- ❌ `MaintenanceManagement is not defined` - JS file didn't load
- ❌ `WeatherIntegration is not defined` - JS file didn't load
- ❌ `404 Not Found: maintenance-management.js` - Netlify deploy not complete
- ❌ `404 Not Found: weather-integration.js` - Netlify deploy not complete

**Solution:** Wait 5 minutes, hard refresh, check Netlify deploy logs.
