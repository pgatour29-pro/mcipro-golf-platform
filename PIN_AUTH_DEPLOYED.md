# Society Organizer PIN Authentication - DEPLOYED

## Status: LIVE on https://mycaddipro.com

The PIN authentication system has been successfully deployed to production.

## CRITICAL: Run SQL Migration in Supabase

The code is deployed but **you must run the SQL migration** to create the database table and function.

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**
   - URL: https://app.supabase.com
   - Select your project

2. **Open SQL Editor**
   - Click "SQL Editor" in left sidebar
   - Click "New Query"

3. **Copy and Run the SQL**
   - Open file: `C:/Users/pete/Documents/MciPro/sql/society-organizer-pin-auth.sql`
   - Copy entire contents
   - Paste into SQL Editor
   - Click **RUN**

4. **Verify Success**
   - Should see "Success. No rows returned"
   - Check that table was created:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM society_organizer_access;
     ```
   - Should return 1 row with default PIN

---

## Testing the PIN Authentication

1. **Open the site**
   - Go to: https://mycaddipro.com

2. **Enable Dev Mode**
   - Press: `Ctrl + Shift + D`
   - Dev Mode switcher appears

3. **Click "Society Organizer"**
   - PIN modal should appear
   - Enter PIN: **1234**
   - Click "Verify"

4. **Success!**
   - Should access Society Organizer Dashboard
   - PIN persists during browser session

---

## IMPORTANT: Change Default PIN

**After testing works**, change the PIN in Supabase:

```sql
UPDATE society_organizer_access
SET access_pin = 'YOUR_NEW_PIN'
WHERE description = 'Default Society Organizer PIN - Please change this!';
```

**Recommended:** Use a 6-digit PIN like `928374` (not 1234!)

---

## How It Works

### User Flow:
1. User clicks "Society Organizer" in Dev Mode
2. System checks if PIN already verified (sessionStorage)
3. If not verified ‚Üí PIN modal appears
4. User enters PIN
5. System calls `verify_society_organizer_pin()` function in Supabase
6. If correct ‚Üí Sets session flag and grants access
7. If incorrect ‚Üí Shows error, user can retry

### Session Behavior:
- PIN verification persists during browser session
- Automatically clears when browser tab closes
- Must re-enter after browser restart

### Security:
- PIN stored in database (not in frontend code)
- Session-based (no permanent cookies)
- Secure Supabase RPC function
- Password-masked input
- RLS policies protect database

## Files Modified

1. **index.html**
   - Added PIN modal (around line 25287)
   - Added PIN authentication JavaScript (after line 28956)
   - Modified DevMode.switchToRole to check PIN

2. **Created:**
   - `sql/society-organizer-pin-auth.sql` - Database migration
   - `mycaddipro-live.html` - Downloaded live site
   - `mycaddipro-live-backup.html` - Backup before modification
   - `add_pin_auth_to_live.py` - Python script used for integration
   - `PIN_AUTH_DEPLOYED.md` - This file

---

## Troubleshooting

### PIN Modal Doesn't Appear
- Check browser console for errors
- Look for: "[SocietyAuth] PIN Authentication System loaded"
- Verify JavaScript loaded correctly

### PIN Always Fails
- **MOST LIKELY:** SQL migration not run yet!
- Run the SQL in Supabase SQL Editor
- Verify table exists: `SELECT * FROM society_organizer_access;`
- Check function exists: `SELECT verify_society_organizer_pin('1234');`

### Database Connection Error
- Check Supabase is online
- Verify `window.SupabaseDB.client` exists
- Check browser network tab for failed requests

## What's Next

Once PIN auth is working:

1. ‚úÖ Change default PIN to secure value
2. ‚úÖ Test with multiple users
3. üîú Move to Phase 2: Golfer-facing features
   - Events browse page
   - Registration flow
   - Waitlist management
   - Pairings system

## Summary

‚úÖ Code deployed to https://mycaddipro.com
‚ö†Ô∏è **ACTION REQUIRED:** Run SQL migration in Supabase
üîí Default PIN: **1234** (change after testing!)

**The system is ready - just run the SQL and test!**
