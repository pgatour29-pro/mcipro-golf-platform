# Society Organizer PIN Authentication - Per-Organizer System DEPLOYED

## Status: LIVE on https://mycaddipro.com

The updated PIN authentication system is now deployed. Each society organizer can set their own PIN from the Admin tab.

---

## What Changed

### Before:
- Single global PIN for all society organizers
- PIN set in database only

### After:
- Each organizer sets their own PIN
- PIN managed from Admin tab in Society Organizer Dashboard
- Optional - organizers can choose whether to use PIN protection

---

## CRITICAL: Run New SQL Migration

The old PIN table structure needs to be replaced. Run this SQL in Supabase:

**File:** `sql/society-organizer-pin-auth-per-organizer.sql`

```sql
-- Society Organizer PIN Authentication - Per Organizer

-- Drop old table if exists
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS society_organizer_access CASCADE;

-- Create new table with organizer_id
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS society_organizer_access (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    organizer_id TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,  -- LINE user ID of the organizer
    access_pin TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE society_organizer_access ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Allow anonymous read access (PIN verification)
CREATE POLICY "Allow anonymous read for PIN verification"
ON society_organizer_access
FOR SELECT
TO anon
USING (true);

-- Allow anonymous insert (when organizer sets PIN for first time)
CREATE POLICY "Allow anonymous insert for setting PIN"
ON society_organizer_access
FOR INSERT
TO anon
WITH CHECK (true);

-- Allow anonymous update (when organizer changes PIN)
CREATE POLICY "Allow anonymous update for changing PIN"
ON society_organizer_access
FOR UPDATE
TO anon
USING (true);

-- Create index for faster lookups
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_society_organizer_access_organizer
ON society_organizer_access(organizer_id);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_society_organizer_access_pin
ON society_organizer_access(organizer_id, access_pin);

-- Function to verify PIN for specific organizer
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION verify_society_organizer_pin(org_id TEXT, input_pin TEXT)
RETURNS BOOLEAN
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM society_organizer_access
        WHERE organizer_id = org_id AND access_pin = input_pin
    );
END;
$$;

-- Function to check if organizer has PIN set
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION organizer_has_pin(org_id TEXT)
RETURNS BOOLEAN
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM society_organizer_access
        WHERE organizer_id = org_id
    );
END;
$$;

-- Function to set/update organizer PIN
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION set_organizer_pin(org_id TEXT, new_pin TEXT)
RETURNS BOOLEAN
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO society_organizer_access (organizer_id, access_pin)
    VALUES (org_id, new_pin)
    ON CONFLICT (organizer_id)
    DO UPDATE SET
        access_pin = new_pin,
        updated_at = NOW();

    RETURN true;
END;
$$;
```

## How It Works Now

### User Experience:

1. **First Time Access (No PIN Set)**
   - Organizer clicks "Society Organizer" in Dev Mode
   - Directly accesses dashboard (no PIN required yet)
   - Can navigate to Admin tab to set up PIN

2. **Setting Up PIN**
   - Go to Society Organizer Dashboard
   - Click "Admin" tab
   - Click "Set PIN" button
   - Enter 4-6 digit PIN
   - Confirm PIN
   - Click "Save PIN"

3. **Subsequent Access (After PIN Set)**
   - Organizer clicks "Society Organizer" in Dev Mode
   - PIN modal appears
   - Enter their personal PIN
   - Access granted to dashboard

4. **Changing PIN**
   - Go to Admin tab
   - Click "Change PIN" button
   - Enter new PIN and confirm
   - Save

### Security Features:
- Each organizer has their own unique PIN
- PIN stored per organizer_id (LINE user ID)
- Session-based verification
- PIN can be changed anytime from Admin tab
- Optional - organizers choose whether to enable PIN

## Testing the New System

### Test 1: First Access (No PIN)
1. Open https://mycaddipro.com

### Test 2: Set PIN
1. In Society Organizer Dashboard

5. Enter PIN: `1234` (for testing)
6. Confirm PIN: `1234`
7. Click "Save PIN"
8. Should see success message
9. Status should change to "PIN Enabled"

### Test 3: PIN Verification
1. Logout or clear session (close browser)
2. Open https://mycaddipro.com again
3. Press `Ctrl+Shift+D`
4. Click "Society Organizer"
5. PIN modal should appear

## Database Functions

### 1. `organizer_has_pin(org_id TEXT)`
**Purpose:** Check if organizer has PIN set
**Returns:** Boolean
**Usage:** Called when accessing Society Organizer to determine if PIN prompt needed

### 2. `verify_society_organizer_pin(org_id TEXT, input_pin TEXT)`
**Purpose:** Verify PIN for specific organizer
**Returns:** Boolean
**Usage:** Called when organizer enters PIN in modal

### 3. `set_organizer_pin(org_id TEXT, new_pin TEXT)`
**Purpose:** Create or update organizer's PIN
**Returns:** Boolean
**Usage:** Called from Admin tab when setting/changing PIN

---

## Files Modified

### 1. `index.html`
**Changes:**
- Added Admin tab button in Society Organizer Dashboard (line ~24901)
- Added Admin tab content with PIN management UI (line ~25206)
- Updated PIN authentication JavaScript (per-organizer logic)
- Added PIN management methods to SocietyOrganizerManager class:
  - `loadPinStatus()`
  - `showPinSetup()`
  - `showChangePinForm()`
  - `cancelPinSetup()`
  - `saveDashboardPin()`
- Updated `showOrganizerTab()` to auto-load PIN status

### 2. Created Files:
- `sql/society-organizer-pin-auth-per-organizer.sql` - New database schema
- `add_admin_tab.py` - Script that added Admin tab
- `add_pin_methods.py` - Script that added PIN methods
- `SOCIETY_PIN_PER_ORGANIZER_DEPLOYED.md` - This file

---

## Validation Rules

### PIN Requirements:
- Minimum 4 digits
- Maximum 6 digits
- Must be numbers only
- Both entries must match
- Cannot be empty

### Error Messages:
- "PIN must be at least 4 digits"
- "PINs do not match"
- "PIN must contain only numbers"
- "User not authenticated"
- "Failed to save PIN"

---

## Session Behavior

### When PIN is Required:
- Checked only when accessing Society Organizer dashboard
- Session flag: `society_organizer_verified`
- Stored in: `sessionStorage` (clears on browser close)

### When Session Clears:
- Browser tab closed
- Browser completely closed
- Manual logout
- After changing PIN (for security)

---

## Security Considerations

### Current Implementation:
‚úÖ Per-organizer PINs
‚úÖ Session-based verification
‚úÖ PIN stored in database
‚úÖ Supabase RLS policies
‚úÖ Secure RPC functions
‚úÖ Password-masked input
‚úÖ Numeric validation

### Future Enhancements:
- Hash PINs with bcrypt
- Failed attempt lockout (3 strikes)
- PIN expiry (force change every 90 days)
- Audit log of access attempts
- Email alerts on failed attempts
- Two-factor authentication

---

## Troubleshooting

### PIN Modal Doesn't Appear
**Cause:** Organizer hasn't set PIN yet
**Solution:** This is expected! Set PIN from Admin tab first

### Can't Save PIN
**Check:**
1. SQL migration ran successfully
2. Functions exist in Supabase
3. Browser console for errors
4. Network tab for failed requests

### Wrong PIN Error Every Time
**Check:**
1. Verify organizer_id is correct
2. Check PIN stored in database:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM society_organizer_access
   WHERE organizer_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID';
   ```
3. Ensure PIN matches exactly (case-sensitive for user ID)

### PIN Doesn't Persist
**Check:**
1. SessionStorage enabled in browser
2. Not in private/incognito mode
3. Session not cleared between attempts

---

## Migration from Old System

If you previously ran the old SQL migration (`society-organizer-pin-auth.sql`), the new migration will:

1. Drop the old `society_organizer_access` table
2. Create new table with `organizer_id` column
3. Create new functions with updated signatures

**Old default PIN (1234) will be removed** - organizers must set their own PINs.

---

## Next Steps for Phase 2

With PIN security in place, you're ready for:

1. ‚úÖ PIN authentication implemented
2. ‚úÖ Admin tab for organizer settings
3. üîú Golfer-facing features:
   - Events browse page
   - Registration flow
   - Waitlist management
   - Pairings system
   - Calendar view
   - Recurring events

---
