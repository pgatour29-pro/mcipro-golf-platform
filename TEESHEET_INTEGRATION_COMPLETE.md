# Tee Sheet Cloud Sync Integration - COMPLETE ✅

**Date:** October 4, 2025
**Status:** Phase 1 Deployed to Production
**Production URL:** https://mcipro-golf-platform.netlify.app

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. CloudSyncAdapter Class ✅
**Location:** `teesheetproshop.html` lines 317-592

**Features:**
- Converts tee sheet bookings to unified platform format
- Converts unified format back to tee sheet format
- Saves bookings to Netlify Blobs cloud storage
- Loads bookings from cloud storage
- Handles 409 conflicts with automatic retry
- Delete bookings via tombstone pattern

**Key Methods:**
```javascript
CloudSyncAdapter.saveBookings(bookings, slot, lane)
CloudSyncAdapter.loadBookings()
CloudSyncAdapter.deleteBooking(bookingId)
CloudSyncAdapter.convertToUnifiedFormat(teeSheetBooking, slot, lane)
CloudSyncAdapter.convertFromUnifiedFormat(unifiedBookings)
```

---

### 2. Unified Booking Format ✅
**Purpose:** Single data structure shared between tee sheet and golfer dashboard

**Format:**
```javascript
{
  // Core fields
  id: string,
  kind: 'tee',
  groupId: string,

  // Time fields
  date: 'YYYY-MM-DD',
  time: 'HH:MM',
  teeTime: ISO timestamp,

  // Course fields
  course: string,
  courseId: string,
  courseName: string,
  teeNumber: number,

  // Booking fields
  bookingType: 'regular'|'tournament'|'lesson'|'maintenance',
  status: 'confirmed'|'pending'|'cancelled',
  players: number,

  // Privacy control
  isPrivate: boolean,
  isPublic: boolean,

  // Golfer data
  golfers: [
    {
      id, name, phone, email, handicap, isVIP,
      caddieId, caddieName
    }
  ],

  // Metadata
  notes: string,
  eventName: string,
  durationMin: 240,
  updatedAt: timestamp,
  syncStatus: 'synced',
  source: 'teesheet'
}
```

**Plus separate caddie bookings** (kind: 'caddie') for each golfer with a caddy

---

### 3. Integrated Cloud Sync ✅
**Location:** `teesheetproshop.html` lines 3003-3057

**How It Works:**
1. User creates/edits booking in tee sheet modal
2. Booking saved to local React state (`demoRows`)
3. **Immediately synced to cloud** via `CloudSyncAdapter.saveBookings()`
4. Server merges with existing bookings using last-write-wins
5. Returns new version number
6. Local version updated

**On Cancellation:**
1. Booking marked as `status: 'cancelled'`
2. Deleted from cloud via tombstone (`deleted: true`)
3. Server removes from storage
4. Removed from local state

**Success Indicators:**
- Console: `[TeeSheet] Booking saved and synced to cloud, version: X`
- Console: `[CloudSync] Saved successfully, version: X`

**Failure Handling:**
- Alert shown to user if cloud sync fails
- Booking still saved locally
- User notified it may not appear on other devices

---

### 4. Privacy Controls ✅
**Location:** `teesheetproshop.html` lines 1793-1844

**UI Component:**
- Checkbox in booking modal
- Highlighted border when private (blue vs gray)
- Multilingual labels (EN/TH/KO/JP)
- Help text explains visibility

**Behavior:**
- `isPrivate: true` → Only staff/proshop can see booking details
- `isPrivate: false` → All golfers can see booking details (default)

**Storage:**
- Saved in booking object
- Synced to cloud
- Preserved on edits

## How to Test

### Test 1: Tee Sheet → Cloud → Golfer Dashboard

1. **Open Tee Sheet:**
   - Navigate to: `https://mcipro-golf-platform.netlify.app/teesheetproshop.html`

2. **Create Booking:**
   - Click empty time slot (e.g., 08:00 AM, Course A)
   - Add golfer: "John Doe"
   - Assign caddy (optional)
   - Check/uncheck "Private Booking"
   - Save

3. **Verify Cloud Sync:**
   - Open browser console
   - Look for: `[TeeSheet] Booking saved and synced to cloud, version: X`
   - Look for: `[CloudSync] Saved successfully, version: X`

4. **Check Golfer Dashboard:**
   - Open: `https://mcipro-golf-platform.netlify.app/index.html`
   - Login as golfer
   - Go to Schedule tab
   - Refresh if needed
   - **Expected:** Booking appears in schedule list

5. **Verify Privacy:**
   - If booking was marked private:
     - Staff should see full details
     - Golfers should only see time blocked (future enhancement)

---

### Test 2: Golfer Dashboard → Cloud → Tee Sheet

1. **Open Golfer Dashboard:**
   - Navigate to: `https://mcipro-golf-platform.netlify.app/index.html`
   - Login as golfer

2. **Create Booking:**
   - Go to Booking tab
   - Select course, date, time
   - Add golfer details
   - Book caddy (optional)
   - Confirm booking

3. **Verify Cloud Sync:**
   - Open browser console
   - Look for: `[SimpleCloudSync] Loaded from cloud: {...}`

4. **Check Tee Sheet:**
   - Open: `https://mcipro-golf-platform.netlify.app/teesheetproshop.html`
   - Find the time slot
   - **Expected:** Booking appears in grid (after implementing load on init)

---

## Known Limitations

### 1. Tee Sheet Load on Init - NOT IMPLEMENTED YET
**Issue:** Tee sheet doesn't load existing bookings from cloud when page opens
**Impact:** Bookings created in golfer dashboard won't show in tee sheet until we add this
**Next Step:** Implement in Phase 2

### 2. No Real-time Updates
**Issue:** Changes don't appear instantly on other devices
**Impact:** Users must refresh to see updates
**Workaround:** Manual refresh
**Future:** Add 30s polling or WebSockets

### 3. No Conflict Resolution UI
**Issue:** 409 conflicts handled silently with retry
**Impact:** Users don't know when their booking was rebased
**Future:** Show notification when conflict resolved

### 4. Privacy Not Enforced in UI Yet
**Issue:** Privacy flag saved but not enforced in golfer dashboard
**Impact:** Golfers can see all booking details regardless of isPrivate flag
**Next Step:** Filter booking details in golfer dashboard based on isPrivate

---

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

### 1. Load Bookings on Tee Sheet Init ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Where:** Add to tee sheet App component
**Code:**
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  async function loadCloudBookings() {
    const result = await CloudSyncAdapter.loadBookings();
    if (result.success) {
      // Merge cloud bookings into demoRows
      // Map bookings to time slots
    }
  }
  loadCloudBookings();
}, []);
```

### 2. Enforce Privacy in Golfer Dashboard
**Where:** `index.html` renderScheduleList()
**Logic:**
```javascript
// Filter out private booking details
if (booking.isPrivate && currentUserRole !== 'staff') {
  return {
    ...booking,
    golfers: [{ name: 'Private Booking' }],
    notes: '',
    // Hide sensitive info
  };
}
```

### 3. Add Polling for Real-time Updates
**Where:** Tee sheet App component
**Code:**
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const interval = setInterval(async () => {
    const result = await CloudSyncAdapter.loadBookings();
    // Update state if version changed
  }, 30000); // Every 30s
  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, []);
```

### 4. Caddy Schedule Sync
**Create:** `/.netlify/functions/caddy-schedules`
**Update:** Check caddy availability before showing in modal
