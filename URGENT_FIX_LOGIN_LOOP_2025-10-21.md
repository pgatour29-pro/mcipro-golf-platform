# URGENT FIX: Login Loop - Complete Recovery Guide

**Date:** 2025-10-21
**Commit:** f9fafb1b (REVERTED)
**Status:** ‚úÖ Database URL fixed, ‚è≥ RLS policies need update

---

## What Happened (My Mistakes)

### Mistake 1: Changed to Non-Existent Database
- Saw `pyeeplwsnupmhgbguwqs` in console errors
- **WRONGLY assumed** it was the incorrect database
- Changed to `voxwtgkffaqmowpxhxbp` which **DOESN'T EXIST**
- Result: Complete system failure

### Mistake 2: Didn't Commit Config File
- First deployment only committed `index.html`
- Never committed `supabase-config.js` changes
- Result: Partial deployment, mixed database URLs

### What I Should Have Done
- Fixed the RLS policy errors instead of changing databases
- The errors were **fixable** - just needed SQL update

---

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ FIXED (Deployed at 11:21:14)
- **Database URL reverted** to correct: `pyeeplwsnupmhgbguwqs.supabase.co`
- **All files committed** and deployed
- **Service Worker** updated to version `2025-10-21T11:21:14Z`
- **Commit:** f9fafb1b

### ‚è≥ NEEDS FIXING
- **RLS Policy Errors** causing:
  ```
  infinite recursion detected in policy for relation "chat_room_members"
  infinite recursion detected in policy for relation "room_members"
  ```

---

## How to Fix (2 Steps)

### Step 1: Clear Browser Cache (CRITICAL)

**You MUST do this or the old code will keep loading:**

1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to **Application** tab
3. Under **Storage**, click **"Clear site data"** button
4. Under **Service Workers**, click **"Unregister"**
5. **Close and reopen browser completely**
6. Hard refresh: **Ctrl+Shift+R**

### Step 2: Fix RLS Policies in Supabase

This fixes the "infinite recursion" errors preventing chat and login from working.

1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard**: https://supabase.com/dashboard

2. Select project: **pyeeplwsnupmhgbguwqs**

3. Go to **SQL Editor**

4. Click **New Query**

5. Copy the ENTIRE contents of this file:
   ```
   C:\Users\pete\Documents\MciPro\chat\FIX_RLS_RECURSION_COMPLETE.sql
   ```

6. Paste into SQL Editor

7. Click **RUN** (‚èµ)

8. You should see:
   ```
   ‚úÖ RLS infinite recursion fixed!
   üìù Created 4 SECURITY DEFINER helper functions
   üîê Recreated all RLS policies without recursion
   üöÄ Chat system should now work without 500 errors
   ```

9. **Done!** The infinite recursion errors are fixed.

## Test After Fixing

1. **Clear browser cache again** (see Step 1)

2. Go to: https://mycaddipro.com

3. Try logging in with LINE

4. **Expected behavior:**
   - ‚úÖ LOGIN page loads
   - ‚úÖ Click "Login with LINE"
   - ‚úÖ Redirected to LINE
   - ‚úÖ Authorize
   - ‚úÖ Redirected back
   - ‚úÖ Dashboard loads (NO LOOP!)

5. **Console should show:**
   ```
   [Supabase] Client initialized and ready
   [LINE OAuth DEBUG] OAuth callback detected
   ‚úÖ State validation PASSED
   ‚úÖ FETCH COMPLETED
   ‚úÖ Profile received
   ```

6. **NO MORE ERRORS for:**
   - `chat_room_members` infinite recursion ‚úÖ
   - `room_members` infinite recursion ‚úÖ
   - WebSocket connection failures ‚úÖ
   - `ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED` ‚úÖ

---

## What Was the RLS Issue?

**Problem:** RLS policies were querying the same tables they were protecting:

```sql
-- BROKEN POLICY (caused recursion):
CREATE POLICY "chat_messages_select" ON chat_messages
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM chat_room_members  -- ‚Üê Queries chat_room_members
    WHERE ...
  )
);

-- But chat_room_members ALSO has a policy that queries chat_messages!
-- Result: Infinite loop when checking permissions
```

**Solution:** Create SECURITY DEFINER functions that bypass RLS:

```sql
-- Helper function (bypasses RLS)
CREATE FUNCTION user_is_in_room(p_room_id uuid)
SECURITY DEFINER  -- ‚Üê This bypasses RLS checks
AS $$ ... $$;

-- NEW POLICY (no recursion):
CREATE POLICY "chat_messages_select" ON chat_messages
USING (
  user_is_in_room(room_id)  -- ‚Üê Uses function instead of subquery
);
```

---

## Files Involved

### Fixed in Latest Deployment (f9fafb1b):
1. `supabase-config.js` - Database URL: `pyeeplwsnupmhgbguwqs.supabase.co`
2. `index.html` - Preconnect URLs + OAuth exchange URL
3. `sw.js` - Service Worker version bump

### SQL Fix Required (Manual):
1. `chat/FIX_RLS_RECURSION_COMPLETE.sql` - RLS policy fix (240 lines)

---

## Verification Checklist

After completing both steps, verify:

- [ ] Browser cache cleared completely
- [ ] Service Worker unregistered
- [ ] Browser closed and reopened
- [ ] SQL fix applied in Supabase
- [ ] Login page loads
- [ ] Can log in with LINE
- [ ] Dashboard loads (no loop)
- [ ] No console errors about recursion
- [ ] Chat system loads
- [ ] Society events load

---

## If Still Having Issues

### Issue: Login loop persists
**Cause:** Browser cache not cleared
**Fix:** Follow Step 1 again, make sure to **close and reopen browser**

### Issue: 500 errors on chat_room_members
**Cause:** RLS policy fix not applied
**Fix:** Run the SQL from `chat/FIX_RLS_RECURSION_COMPLETE.sql`

### Issue: Society events not loading
**Cause:** Different issue - database might be empty
**Fix:** Run the import scripts:
- `sql/import-trgg-october-schedule.sql`
- `sql/import-trgg-november-schedule.sql`

### Issue: ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED
**Cause:** Still seeing old code with wrong database URL
**Fix:** Clear cache more aggressively:
1. Chrome Settings > Privacy > Clear browsing data
2. Select "Cached images and files"
3. Clear from "All time"
4. Restart browser

## Summary

| Component | Status | Action Required |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| Database URL | ‚úÖ Fixed | None - already deployed |
| Config Files | ‚úÖ Fixed | None - already committed |
| Service Worker | ‚úÖ Updated | Clear browser cache |
| RLS Policies | ‚ùå Broken | Run SQL fix in Supabase |
| Chat System | ‚è≥ Will work | After RLS fix + cache clear |
| Login System | ‚è≥ Will work | After RLS fix + cache clear |

## My Apologies

I made multiple critical errors:
1. Changed to wrong database without verifying it existed
2. Didn't commit all files in first deployment
3. Didn't check compacted folder for existing RLS fixes
4. Caused you to be stuck in login loop

The system WILL work after:
- ‚úÖ Database URL fix (DONE - deployed)
- ‚è≥ RLS policy fix (NEEDS - run SQL)
- ‚è≥ Browser cache clear (NEEDS - user action)

---

**Next Steps:**
1. Clear browser cache (Step 1 above)
2. Run RLS fix SQL (Step 2 above)
3. Test login
4. System should be 100% working
