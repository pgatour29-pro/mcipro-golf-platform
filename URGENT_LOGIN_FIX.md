# URGENT: Login Loop Fix - What Happened & How to Fix

## What I Screwed Up

I changed the Supabase database URL but **FORGOT TO COMMIT** the `supabase-config.js` file in my first deployment. This meant:
- The chat system was still using the OLD database
- But index.html was using the NEW database
- Complete mismatch causing errors

## What I Just Fixed (Deployed at 11:13:43)

✅ **COMMITTED** and **DEPLOYED** the `supabase-config.js` fix
- Database URL now correct: `voxwtgkffaqmowpxhxbp.supabase.co`
- Anon key updated
- Commit: 1357b4cf

## What's STILL Broken

❌ **LINE OAuth Edge Function missing on new database**

The error you're seeing:
```
voxwtgkffaqmowpxhxbp.supabase.co/functions/v1/line-oauth-exchange:1
Failed to load resource: net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED
```

This is because the `line-oauth-exchange` Edge Function exists locally but is NOT deployed to the new Supabase instance.

## IMMEDIATE FIX - Two Options:

### Option 1: Deploy Edge Function (RECOMMENDED)

1. Install Supabase CLI:
```bash
npm install -g supabase
```

2. Login to Supabase:
```bash
cd C:\Users\pete\Documents\MciPro
supabase login
```

3. Link to your project:
```bash
supabase link --project-ref voxwtgkffaqmowpxhxbp
```

4. Deploy the function:
```bash
supabase functions deploy line-oauth-exchange
```

5. Set required environment variables in Supabase Dashboard:
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/voxwtgkffaqmowpxhxbp/settings/functions
   - Add secrets:
     - `LINE_CHANNEL_ID` = [your LINE channel ID]
     - `LINE_CHANNEL_SECRET` = [your LINE channel secret]

### Option 2: Clear Everything and Login Fresh

1. **Clear browser completely:**
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Application > Storage > Clear site data
   - Application > Service Workers > Unregister
   - Close and reopen browser

2. **Go directly to mycaddipro.com** (don't use LINE login link)

3. **Try logging in fresh**

## What You'll Need

If deploying Edge Function, you need:
- LINE Channel ID
- LINE Channel Secret

These are from: https://developers.line.biz/console/

## Current Status

✅ Database URL fix deployed (commit 1357b4cf)
✅ Chat system will use correct database (after cache clear)
❌ OAuth exchange function NOT deployed yet
❌ You're stuck in login loop until function is deployed

## My Mistake

I should have:
1. Checked that ALL files were committed
2. Tested the deployment before telling you it was done
3. Realized the Edge Function would need to be deployed separately

I fucked up. Let me know which option you want to try and I'll help you fix it right now.
