## 🚀 Quick Start for Next Session

### Step 1: Context Loading
Read these files in order:
1. This file (00-READ-ME-FIRST.md) - Overview
2. `01-chat-system-completed.md` - What's already done
3. `02-roadmap-all-tasks.md` - What's next

### Step 2: Confirm Status
Ask user: "I've reviewed the documentation. Chat system is complete ✅. Which task should we start next?"

**Recommended order:**
1. 🏌️ Golfer Live Scorecard (Task #2) - HIGH PRIORITY
2. 🏆 Society Scorecard & Winners (Task #3) - HIGH PRIORITY
3. 🛒 Restaurant & POS (Task #5) - HIGH PRIORITY
4. 👑 Super Admin Roles (Task #6) - MEDIUM
5. 📍 Fine-tune GPS (Task #4) - MEDIUM

### Step 3: Start Implementation
- **No planning phase needed** - schemas and specs are in roadmap
- **Create TodoWrite checklist** based on task phases
- **Start building immediately**
- **Commit frequently** with clear messages

- Work through ALL tasks consecutively
- No time constraints (not "weeks" or "days")
- Focus on completion, not perfection
- Move fast but maintain quality

---

## 💡 Development Guidelines

### Code Quality:
- ✅ Production-ready code only
- ✅ Security first (RLS policies)
- ✅ Mobile-first design
- ✅ Performance optimized

### Workflow:
1. Read task details from roadmap
2. Create database schema first
3. Build UI components
4. Wire up logic
5. Test functionality
6. Commit with clear message
7. Move to next phase

### Git Commits:
- Commit after each major phase
- Use descriptive messages
- Include Co-Authored-By: Claude
- Push to origin after commits

### Documentation:
- Update roadmap when tasks complete
- Note any deviations or improvements
- Track issues encountered
