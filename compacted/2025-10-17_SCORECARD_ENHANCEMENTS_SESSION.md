# Live Scorecard Enhancements - October 17, 2025

## üéØ Session Goal
Refine live scorecard with:
1. Scramble format configuration (team size, drive tracking)
2. Multi-format scoring on single scorecard
3. Fix "Post Scores" bug (use database instead of localStorage)
4. Score distribution to all players and organizers
5. Selective posting checkboxes for handicap

## ‚úÖ Completed Work

### 1. Database Schema Enhancement (COMPLETED ‚úì)
**File:** `sql/03_enhance_rounds_multi_format.sql`
**Status:** Executed successfully in Supabase

**Added to `rounds` table:**
- `scoring_formats` (JSONB) - Array of formats used
- `format_scores` (JSONB) - Score breakdown per format
- `posted_formats` (TEXT[]) - Which formats count for handicap
- `scramble_config` (JSONB) - Scramble settings
- `team_size` (INTEGER) - 2, 3, or 4 players
- `drive_requirements` (JSONB) - Drive tracking data
- `shared_with` (TEXT[]) - Players who can see this round
- `posted_to_organizer` (BOOLEAN) - Sent to society organizer
- `organizer_id` (TEXT) - Society event organizer

**Added to `round_holes` table:**
- `drive_player_id` (TEXT) - Who's drive was used
- `drive_player_name` (TEXT) - Player name
- `putt_player_id` (TEXT) - Who made the putt
- `putt_player_name` (TEXT) - Player name
- `team_score` (INTEGER) - Team score for this hole

**New Database Functions:**
- `archive_scorecard_to_history()` - Enhanced with multi-format support
- `distribute_round_to_players()` - Share round with multiple players
- `get_shared_rounds()` - Get rounds shared with me

**Updated RLS Policies:**
- Rounds visible to owner, shared players, AND organizers

1. Find line ~29909 (`saveRoundToHistory(player) {`)
2. Select entire function (to closing `}`)
3. Replace with code from `SCORECARD_ENHANCEMENT_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` section 2C

### Step 4: Add distributeRoundScores Function

2. Insert code from section 2D of implementation guide

### Step 5: Update completeRound Function
1. Find line ~29884 (`async completeRound() {`)
2. Replace entire function with code from section 2E

## üé® UI Changes - What User Will See

### Before Starting Round:
1. Select "Scramble" format checkbox
2. **NEW:** Scramble configuration panel appears with:
   - Team size selector (2/3/4-man)
   - Drive tracking toggle
   - Minimum drives input (default: 4)
   - Putt tracking toggle

### During Round (if Scramble selected):
- Blue box appears on each hole asking:
  - "Whose drive are you using?" (dropdown with remaining drives needed)
  - "Who made the putt?" (dropdown with all players)

### After Round:
- Scores automatically saved to database
- **NEW:** All players in group receive round in their history
- **NEW:** Society organizer sees completed round
- **NEW:** Multiple format scores displayed:
  ```
  Thailand Stableford: 36 pts
  Stroke Play: 76 strokes
  Scramble: 68 (team score)
  Nassau: F9: +2, B9: -1, Total: +1
  ```

## üîç Technical Changes Summary

### Old Behavior (BROKEN):
```javascript
// saveRoundToHistory() - Line 29948
GolfScoreSystem.saveScore({
    course: courseName,
    score: totalGross,
    // ... saved to localStorage only
});
```
**Problems:**
- Only saved to localStorage (not database)
- Only saved for current user
- Single format only
- Not shared with other players
- Not visible to organizers

### New Behavior (FIXED):
```javascript
// saveRoundToHistory() - Enhanced
await window.SupabaseDB.client
    .from('rounds')
    .insert({
        golfer_id: player.lineUserId,
        scoring_formats: ['stableford', 'strokeplay', 'scramble'],
        format_scores: {
            stableford: 36,
            strokeplay: 76,
            scramble: 68
        },
        scramble_config: {
            teamSize: 4,
            minDrivesPerPlayer: 4
        }
        // ... full database record
    });

// THEN distribute to all players
await window.SupabaseDB.client.rpc(
    'distribute_round_to_players',
    {
        p_round_id: roundId,
        p_player_ids: [userId1, userId2, userId3]
    }
);
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Saves to Supabase database
- ‚úÖ All formats calculated and stored
- ‚úÖ Shared with all players in group
- ‚úÖ Visible to society organizer
- ‚úÖ Scramble metadata tracked
- ‚úÖ Proper RLS security

## üìä Database Structure

### rounds Table Row Example:

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Test 1: Scramble Configuration UI
- [ ] Select Scramble format
- [ ] Verify config panel appears
- [ ] Select 2-man team size
- [ ] Verify UI updates
- [ ] Deselect Scramble
- [ ] Verify panel disappears

### Test 2: Multi-Format Scoring
- [ ] Select: Stableford, Stroke Play, Scramble
- [ ] Add 4 players
- [ ] Start round
- [ ] Enter scores for all 18 holes
- [ ] Complete round
- [ ] Check database: `SELECT * FROM rounds ORDER BY completed_at DESC LIMIT 1`
- [ ] Verify `scoring_formats` = ["stableford", "strokeplay", "scramble"]
- [ ] Verify `format_scores` has all three scores

### Test 3: Score Distribution
- [ ] Complete round with 4 players (all have LINE IDs)
- [ ] Check database: `SELECT shared_with FROM rounds WHERE id = 'xxx'`
- [ ] Verify array has all 4 player IDs
- [ ] Log in as Player 2
- [ ] Navigate to Round History
- [ ] Verify Player 1's round appears

### Test 4: Society Event Distribution
- [ ] Create society event
- [ ] Start round linked to event
- [ ] Complete round
- [ ] Check: `SELECT organizer_id, posted_to_organizer FROM rounds WHERE id = 'xxx'`
- [ ] Verify organizer_id is populated
- [ ] Log in as organizer
- [ ] Verify round visible in dashboard

### Test 5: Scramble Drive Tracking
- [ ] Select Scramble with drive tracking ON
- [ ] Set minimum drives = 4
- [ ] Play hole 1
- [ ] Select Player 1's drive
- [ ] Verify drive counter decrements
- [ ] Play 4 holes using only Player 1's drive
- [ ] Verify UI shows "0 more needed"

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Scramble panel doesn't appear
**Cause:** toggleFormatCheckbox not updated
**Fix:** Apply snippet from `toggle-format-update-snippet.js`

### Issue 2: Scores still saving to localStorage
**Cause:** Old saveRoundToHistory still in use
**Fix:** Replace function with new database version

### Issue 3: Rounds not appearing for other players
**Cause:** distributeRoundScores not called
**Fix:** Update completeRound to call distribution function

### Issue 4: Database insert fails with "column does not exist"
**Cause:** SQL migration not run
**Fix:** Re-run `sql/03_enhance_rounds_multi_format.sql` in Supabase

### Issue 5: RLS policy blocks access
**Cause:** User not in shared_with array
**Fix:** Check distribute_round_to_players was called

## üìà Performance Impact

### Database Queries:
- **Before:** 0 (localStorage only)
- **After:** 2-3 per round completion
  - 1 INSERT into rounds
  - 1 RPC call for distribution
  - 1 SELECT for organizer (if society event)

### Response Time:
- Completion: +500ms (acceptable for end-of-round)
- No impact on score entry (still instant)

### Storage:
- **Before:** ~5KB localStorage per player
- **After:** ~2KB database per player + shared metadata

## üìû Support & Debugging

### Check Database Schema:
```sql
-- Verify columns exist
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'rounds'
  AND column_name IN ('scoring_formats', 'format_scores', 'shared_with');

-- Verify functions exist
SELECT routine_name
FROM information_schema.routines
WHERE routine_schema = 'public'
  AND routine_name IN ('archive_scorecard_to_history', 'distribute_round_to_players');
```

### Check Round Distribution:
```sql
-- See all shared rounds
SELECT
  id,
  golfer_id,
  course_name,
  scoring_formats,
  shared_with,
  organizer_id
FROM rounds
WHERE id = 'your-round-id';
```

### Debug RLS Policies:
```sql
-- Check policies
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd, qual
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'rounds';
```
