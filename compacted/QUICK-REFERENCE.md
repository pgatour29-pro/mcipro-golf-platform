**What It Needs:**
1. Add "Partial" option in payment UI
2. Allow entering partial amount (e.g., ฿1,000 of ฿2,575)

5. Allow multiple partial payments per player

**User Benefit:**

**User Benefit:**
Quickly mark multiple players as paid at once (e.g., after collecting cash at event)

---

### Future Enhancement 3: Payment History & Audit (0% COMPLETE)

**What It Needs:**
1. Payment history modal per player
2. Show all payment events (marked paid, unmarked, amounts)
