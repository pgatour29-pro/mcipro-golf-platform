2. Add 4 backend functions (markPlayerPaid, markPlayerUnpaid, etc.)
3. Add "Paid" column to roster table
4. Add toggle button to mark paid/unpaid
5. Show PAID badge for paid players

**User Requirement:**

2. Add revenue display to event cards
3. Show: "฿5,150 / ฿10,300 (2/4 Paid)"
4. Progress bar with color coding
5. Real-time updates when payments marked

**User Requirement:**
