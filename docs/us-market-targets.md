## 1. TOP 10 US GOLF SOCIETIES & LEAGUES TO TARGET

### Priority Tier: Independent Leagues (Most Likely Using Spreadsheets/Basic Tools)

| # | Organization | Location | Est. Members | Why Target | Contact Approach |
|---|-------------|----------|-------------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Social Golf Leagues (SGL) / Epic Golf** | Central Florida (Orlando area) | 2,000+ active | Operating since 2004, recently merged into Epic Golf (epic.golf). 9-hole social leagues for all levels — men's, ladies, coed. Their tech stack appears basic. Perfect society management use case. | Via epic.golf contact; formerly glogolfing.com |
| 2 | **AZ Golfers ⛳** (Facebook Group) | Phoenix/Scottsdale, AZ | 15,000–25,000 (FB) | One of the largest Arizona golf Facebook communities. Members organize informal groups, buddy rounds, and mini-tournaments. No centralized scoring platform. | Facebook group admins; post engagement |
| 3 | **Arizona Golf Tournaments** (Facebook Group) | Statewide AZ | 10,000+ (FB) | Active tournament-focused community. Members coordinate charity events, corporate outings, and society days using spreadsheets and SignUpGenius. | FB group admin outreach |
| 4 | **USA Golf Lovers** (Facebook Group) | National (US-centric) | 20,000+ (FB) | Large general golf community. Members frequently post about organizing group outings and societies. High engagement, low tech adoption. | FB group admins |
| 5 | **Golf Lover USA** (Facebook Group) | National | 15,000+ (FB) | Active community with regular discussion about golf apps, league organization, and group play. | FB group admin outreach |
| 6 | **LPGA Amateur Golf Association** | National — 130+ chapters | 17,500+ members | Largest women's amateur golf org (formerly EWGA). 7,500+ events annually. Chapters operate semi-independently, many using spreadsheets for local events. Individual chapter approach is key. Target FL, AZ, TX, CA chapters first. | lpgaamateurs.com; reach local chapter presidents |
| 7 | **The Villages Golf Community** | The Villages, FL | 5,000+ active golfers | Massive retirement community with 50+ golf holes, dozens of informal golf societies. Societies organize via email chains and paper sign-up sheets. Enormous underserved market in one location. | Contact The Villages recreation dept; post in Villages Facebook groups |
| 8 | **Myrtle Beach Golf Groups** (various FB groups) | Myrtle Beach, SC | 30,000+ combined | Multiple large FB groups for golf trip planning and society play in the #1 US golf destination. Groups like "Myrtle Beach Golf" and "Myrtle Beach Golf Trip Planning" have massive membership. | FB group admins; partner with local courses |
| 9 | **Houston Golf Association / Houston Corporate Golf League** | Houston, TX | 2,000–3,000 | Strong corporate golf league scene in Houston. Multiple companies run inter-office leagues using spreadsheets. Entry point: corporate golf event organizers. | LinkedIn outreach to corporate event planners; HGA website |
| 10 | **SoCal Golf Group** (Facebook + Meetup) | Los Angeles/San Diego, CA | 8,000–12,000 | Active Southern California golf community organizing weekly outings, mini-tours, and society events. Members regularly discuss needing better scoring/organizing tools. | FB group + Meetup.com organizer outreach |

### ⚠️ Avoid (Already Using Golf Genius):
- **Twilight Golf** — Now a division of Golf Genius. Largest organized league network in the US (2,000+ courses). They are a competitor, not a target.
- **Spark Golf** — Large 9-hole league network across US/Canada. Well-established platform. Could be a partnership play long-term but not an easy displacement.

### 💡 Best Entry Strategy:
Focus on **Facebook-organized golf societies** (groups of 50–500 members) that currently use WhatsApp/group chat + spreadsheets. They have the pain point and no loyalty to existing platforms. The Villages, FL alone could yield 20+ pilot societies.

## 2. TOP 10 US CADDIE COURSES TO APPROACH

Between 650–750 courses in America actively use caddies (per Golf Digest, 2024). The best targets combine large caddie rosters with premium positioning where caddie booking technology adds clear value.

| # | Course | Location | Type | Est. Caddies | Green Fee Range | Why Target |
|---|--------|----------|------|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| 1 | **Bandon Dunes Golf Resort** | Bandon, OR | Resort (5 courses) | 200+ | $275–$395 | Largest caddie operation in the US. Walking-only resort with mandatory/encouraged caddie use across 5 courses. Caddie scheduling is a massive logistics challenge. High-tech friendly management. | 
| 2 | **Pinehurst Resort (No. 2)** | Pinehurst, NC | Resort | 150+ | $250–$595 | Iconic resort with 9 courses. Large caddie program, especially on No. 2 (2024 US Open venue). Caddie coordination across multiple courses = perfect use case. |
| 3 | **Whistling Straits / Kohler Golf** | Kohler, WI | Resort | 100+ | $200–$400 | 4-course resort operation. Strong caddie tradition, Ryder Cup venue. |
| 4 | **Kiawah Island Golf Resort (Ocean Course)** | Kiawah Island, SC | Resort | 80+ | $250–$450 | Premium resort, walking-encouraged on Ocean Course. Strong caddie program with seasonal demand spikes. |
| 5 | **Pebble Beach Golf Links** | Pebble Beach, CA | Resort | 100+ | $625+ | Ultra-premium. Caddies in high demand. Name recognition alone makes this a flagship reference account. |
| 6 | **Pine Valley Golf Club** | Pine Valley, NJ | Ultra-Private | 80+ | Private (est. $500+ equivalent) | Consistently ranked #1 in US. Walking-only, caddies mandatory. Elite reference customer if secured. |
| 7 | **Shinnecock Hills Golf Club** | Southampton, NY | Private | 60+ | Private | Historic club with strong caddie tradition. Multiple US Open host. |
| 8 | **Streamsong Resort** | Bowling Green, FL | Resort (3 courses) | 80+ | $200–$350 | Florida's premier walking/caddie resort. 3 courses, growing caddie program. Being in FL makes it accessible for demos/meetings. |
| 9 | **Sand Valley Golf Resort** | Nekoosa, WI | Resort (4 courses) | 100+ | $175–$325 | Fast-growing resort, walking-focused with strong caddie culture. Modern management likely open to tech solutions. Newest course (Sedge Valley) opened recently. |
| 10 | **TPC Sawgrass (Stadium Course)** | Ponte Vedra Beach, FL | Resort/Tour | 60+ | $350–$600 | PGA Tour flagship. High-profile caddie program. FL location convenient for engagement. |

### 💡 Caddie Program Contact Strategy:
- **Caddie Masters** are the decision-makers for daily operations. Find them via LinkedIn ("Caddie Master" + course name) or call the pro shop directly.
- **WGA/Evans Scholars Foundation** (wgaesf.org) maintains a caddie program locator — they track 200+ courses with active youth caddie programs and could be a distribution partner.
- **Resort GMs/Directors of Golf** are the budget holders for technology purchases.
- Start with **Bandon Dunes** and **Streamsong** — both are known for being tech-forward and have the largest operational pain points.

## 3. KEY US GOLF INFLUENCERS & COMMUNITIES

### Golf YouTube/TikTok Creators (Tech-Friendly)

| Creator | Platform | Subscribers/Followers | Why Relevant |

| **Eric Cogorno** | YouTube | 800K+ | Instruction + tech reviews. Has done golf app features before. |
| **Bryan Bros Golf** | YouTube/TikTok | 500K+ YT, 1M+ TikTok | Entertaining format, younger demographic. Good for viral caddie booking content. |
| **Golf Sidekick** | YouTube | 700K+ | Course strategy focused. Audience is exactly the "walking golfer who would use a caddie" demographic. |
| **Micah Morris (formerly Good Good adjacent)** | YouTube/TikTok | 500K+ | Younger golf audience, tech-savvy. |

### Golf Podcasts (Technology Coverage)

| Podcast | Why Target |
|---------|-----------|
| **The Fried Egg Podcast** | Deep-dive golf architecture and experience podcast. Audience loves walking golf and caddies. Perfect cultural fit. |
| **Chasing Scratch** | Amateur golfer improvement journey. Audience actively seeks tools and apps to improve. |
| **No Laying Up** | Massive following (200K+ across platforms). Covers golf travel, course reviews. Their audience is the MyCaddiPro demographic. |

### Online Communities

| Community | Size | Strategy |

| **r/golf (Reddit)** | 1M+ members | Most active online golf community. "What app do you use for scoring?" threads appear weekly. Post genuinely, answer questions, soft-launch there. Key: don't spam — contribute value first. AMA with founder would work well. |
| **GolfWRX Forums** | 500K+ registered | The "serious golfer" forum. Equipment & technology subforum is active. GolfWRX members are early adopters who write detailed app reviews. Sponsor a "Technology" thread or get a staff review. |
| **The Refuge (Golf Forum)** | 30K+ | Spin-off from GolfWRX. More tight-knit, walking-golf-focused community. Very aligned with caddie culture. Smaller but highly influential. |
| **r/GolfSwing, r/GolfGTI** | 100K+ combined | Niche subreddits with engaged audiences looking for tech solutions. |
| **MyGolfSpy Community** | 200K+ | Data-driven golf testing community. If MyCaddiPro gets a positive review here, it carries enormous credibility. |

### 💡 Influencer Strategy:
1. **Seed with mid-tier creators first** (100K–500K followers) — they're more accessible and have higher engagement rates
2. **r/golf AMA** is free and high-impact — "We built a caddie booking app, AMA" would generate massive engagement
3. **No Laying Up** and **The Fried Egg** sponsorships are the highest-ROI podcast plays for the walking/caddie golf audience
4. **GolfWRX staff review** carries more weight than any paid influencer for the serious golfer demographic
