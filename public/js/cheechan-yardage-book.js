This Par 4 plays straight with a wide-open fairway, providing a chance for all players to rip their first tee shots. The green is guarded by bunkers which can be very tricky, along with the slopes and variety of pin placements."

Some longer hitters can certainly reach the green in two, but those who fall short may pay the price by several green-side bunkers. The green itself also presents a challenge by sloping its way down toward water on the left side."
