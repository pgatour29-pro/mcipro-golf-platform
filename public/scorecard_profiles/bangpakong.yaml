  Bangpakong Riverside Country Club - Par 72 (36-36)

  This scorecard has 5 tee boxes:
  - Black: Championship/Longest (~7,227 yards)

  - White: Senior/Forward (6,393 yards)
  - Yellow: Ladies/Forward (5,458 yards)

  If extraction fails:
  1. Open this file in text editor
  2. Adjust bbox coordinates for specific tee box (move up/down by 0.01-0.05)
  3. Save and try again

  Example: If blue tees row is too high, increase y_start:
  yardage_blue_front:
    bbox: [0.05, 0.32, 0.48, 0.36]  # Was 0.30, now 0.32
