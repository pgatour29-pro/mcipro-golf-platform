# Notes for manual adjustment
notes: |
  If extraction fails:
  1. Open this file in text editor
  2. Adjust bbox coordinates (move up/down by 0.01-0.05)
  3. Save and try again

  Example: If par row is too high, increase y_start:
  par_front:
    bbox: [0.05, 0.54, 0.48, 0.58]  # Was 0.52, now 0.54
