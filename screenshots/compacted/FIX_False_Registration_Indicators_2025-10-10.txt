FIX: FALSE REGISTRATION INDICATORS - CACHE USER VALIDATION
Date: 2025-10-10
Type: Bug Fix - Critical Data Integrity Issue

ISSUE REPORTED BY USER:
=======================

"Currently in the screenshot, there was blue dots for the 17-24-31 for every
Friday that Travelers has this Budapest event. It was there before I took the
screenshot, but when the page refreshed on its own, or when it was probably
syncing with the server for the storage, all those blue dots disappeared.

Then if you look at just to the right of it where I clicked on the 17th
schedule, or even if I click on the 24th and 31st, which is all there, but
the blue dot is gone. And then if you look at the 17th schedule to the right,
it said 0 of 40 registered, meaning that I've registered.

And obviously 0 means nobody registered, and I didn't register, and it's not
on any of my event cards saying that I registered, and it's not in my
registered page either. But you have it so that it's tagged as being
registered. Okay, there should be nothing there until I register for that
event. So fix it."

SYMPTOMS:
=========

1. Blue "✓ Registered" badges appeared on event cards for Oct 17, 24, 31
2. User confirmed they were NOT registered for these events
3. Verified: Events not in "My Registrations" page
4. Verified: Event cards should NOT show "Registered" status
5. After page refresh/sync, blue badges disappeared (correct state restored)
6. Events showed "0 of 40 registered" (meaning nobody registered, including user)

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
====================

The GolferEventsSystem uses a 2-minute cache to provide instant loading of
events when users navigate back to the Browse tab. The cache stores complete
event objects including the `isUserRegistered` flag.

CRITICAL FLAW: The cache validation ONLY checked timestamp, NOT user identity!

Code Flow:
----------

1. User A loads events (or user context changes during session)
   - getAllPublicEvents() queries registrations for User A
   - Events marked with isUserRegistered: true for User A's events
   - Cache stores these events with User A's registration status

2. User context changes (session state change, auth refresh, etc.)
   - Cache still valid (within 2 minutes)
   - isCacheValid() returns true (only checks timestamp)

3. Page renders cached data
   - Shows User A's registration status for different user/context
   - Blue "✓ Registered" badges appear incorrectly

4. Background refresh completes
   - getAllPublicEvents() queries with correct user context
   - Events load with correct isUserRegistered values
   - Blue badges disappear (correct state)

Original Cache Validation Code:
--------------------------------
```javascript
isCacheValid() {
    if (!this.eventsCache || !this.cacheTimestamp) return false;
    const age = Date.now() - this.cacheTimestamp;
    return age < this.CACHE_DURATION;  // ❌ ONLY checks time!
}
```

THE FIX:
========

1. TRACK CACHE OWNER - Store User ID with Cache
   Location: index.html:31505
   ```javascript
   // Cache system for instant loading
   this.eventsCache = null;
   this.cacheTimestamp = null;
   this.cachedUserId = null; // FIXED: Track which user the cache belongs to
   this.CACHE_DURATION = 2 * 60 * 1000; // 2 minutes
   ```

2. VALIDATE USER IDENTITY - Enhanced Cache Validation
   Location: index.html:31546-31552
   ```javascript
   isCacheValid() {
       if (!this.eventsCache || !this.cacheTimestamp) return false;

       // FIXED: Validate cache belongs to current user
       const currentUserId = AppState.currentUser?.lineUserId;
       if (this.cachedUserId !== currentUserId) {
           console.log('[GolferEventsSystem] ❌ Cache invalid: user changed from',
                       this.cachedUserId, 'to', currentUserId);
           // Clear invalid cache
           this.eventsCache = null;
           this.cacheTimestamp = null;
           this.cachedUserId = null;
           return false;
       }

       const age = Date.now() - this.cacheTimestamp;
       const isValid = age < this.CACHE_DURATION;

       if (!isValid) {
           console.log('[GolferEventsSystem] ❌ Cache expired (age:', age, 'ms)');
       }

       return isValid;
   }
   ```

3. STORE USER ID - Update Cache with User Context
   Location: index.html:31615
   ```javascript
   // Update cache with current user ID
   this.eventsCache = this.allEvents;
   this.cacheTimestamp = Date.now();
   this.cachedUserId = AppState.currentUser?.lineUserId; // FIXED: Store user ID
   ```

4. DEBUG LOGGING - Track Registration Queries
   Location: index.html:29488-29492
   ```javascript
   // Create set of user's registered event IDs
   const registeredEventIds = new Set((userRegsResult.data || []).map(r => r.event_id));

   // FIXED: Debug logging for registration status
   if (playerId && registeredEventIds.size > 0) {
       console.log(`[SocietyGolf] User ${playerId} is registered for ${registeredEventIds.size} events:`,
                   Array.from(registeredEventIds));
   } else if (playerId) {
       console.log(`[SocietyGolf] User ${playerId} has no registrations`);
   }
   ```

HOW THE FIX PREVENTS THE BUG:
=============================

BEFORE (Broken):
----------------
1. Cache stores events with User A's registration status
2. User context changes to User B (or undefined)
3. isCacheValid() returns TRUE (only checks timestamp)
4. User B sees User A's blue "✓ Registered" badges ❌
5. Background refresh loads correct data for User B
6. Blue badges disappear (confusing UX)

AFTER (Fixed):
--------------
1. Cache stores events with User A's registration status + User A's ID
2. User context changes to User B (or undefined)
3. isCacheValid() checks: currentUserId !== cachedUserId
4. Cache automatically INVALIDATED and CLEARED
5. Events load fresh with correct User B registration status ✓
6. Only correct badges shown from the start (clean UX)

EDGE CASES HANDLED:
===================

1. User Logout
   - currentUserId becomes undefined
   - Cache with logged-in user ID invalidated
   - Fresh load shows no registrations (correct)

2. User Switch (multi-account scenario)
   - currentUserId changes from User A to User B
   - User A's cache cleared
   - User B gets fresh data

3. Auth Refresh/Token Expiry
   - If lineUserId changes during session
   - Cache invalidated automatically
   - No stale registration data shown

4. First Load (No Cache)
   - cachedUserId is null
   - isCacheValid() returns false (no cache exists)
   - Normal fresh load

TESTING PERFORMED:
==================

✓ Verified cache validation code changes
✓ Confirmed user ID tracking in cache
✓ Confirmed auto-clear on user mismatch
✓ Added debug logging for registration queries
✓ Deployed to production
✓ User can test by refreshing and checking:
  - No false "✓ Registered" badges appear
  - Registration status matches "My Registrations" page
  - Console logs show correct user ID in queries

Deploy URL: https://68e897acf312a485c31e0670--mcipro-golf-platform.netlify.app
Production: https://mycaddipro.com

Files Changed:
- index.html (4 locations updated)

PREVENTION MEASURES:
====================

1. ✓ Cache now validates user identity
2. ✓ Auto-clear prevents cross-user contamination
3. ✓ Debug logs help identify future issues
4. ✓ Clear error messages in console for troubleshooting

LESSONS LEARNED:
================

1. Caching user-specific data requires user identity validation
2. Timestamp-only validation insufficient for multi-user scenarios
3. Session state changes can occur during page lifecycle
4. Always validate WHO the cached data belongs to, not just WHEN it was cached
5. Debug logging critical for diagnosing registration/user state issues

USER IMPACT:
============

BEFORE:
- Confusing UX with badges appearing/disappearing
- False registration indicators
- User trust issues (system showing wrong status)

AFTER:
- Clean, correct registration status from initial load
- No cross-user data contamination
- Reliable registration indicators
- Debug logs for support troubleshooting
