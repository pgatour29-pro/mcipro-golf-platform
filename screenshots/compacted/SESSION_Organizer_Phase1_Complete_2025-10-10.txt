🔍 DETAILED CODE CHANGES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

FILE: C:\Users\pete\Documents\MciPro\index.html

SECTION 1: Database Layer Enhancements
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Lines: 29719-29886 (168 lines added)
Location: SocietyGolfSupabase class

New Methods:
1. getOrganizerEventsWithStats(organizerId)
   - Fetches all events for organizer
   - Runs parallel queries for registrations and waitlist
   - Calculates comprehensive stats per event
   - Returns events with embedded stats object

   Stats Object Structure:
   {
     registered: number,        // Count of confirmed registrations
     waitlist: number,          // Count on waitlist
     transportCount: number,    // Players requesting transport
     competitionCount: number,  // Players in competition
     paidCount: number,         // Players who have paid
     revenue: number            // Total revenue in THB
   }

2. getEventRegistrationsWithPlayers(eventId)
   - Fetches all registrations for an event
   - Converts snake_case to camelCase
   - Includes payment status and dates
   - Orders by creation date

3. calculateEventRevenue(event, registrations)
   - Calculates total event revenue
   - Base fees: green + cart + caddy (all players)
   - Optional add-ons: transport + competition
   - Returns total in THB

4. updatePaymentStatus(registrationId, isPaid)
   - Updates is_paid flag
   - Sets payment_date when marked paid
   - Clears payment_date when marked unpaid
   - Ready for Phase 2 payment tracking UI

Performance:
- Uses Promise.all() for parallel queries
- Single pass for stats calculation
- No redundant database calls
- Efficient filtering with .in() operator

SECTION 2: Event Loading Enhancement
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Lines: 30015-30037 (modified existing method)
Location: SocietyOrganizerManager class

Changed From:
async loadEvents() {
    this.events = await SocietyGolfDB.getEvents();
    this.renderEventsList();
}

Changed To:
async loadEvents() {
    const organizerId = AppState.currentUser?.lineUserId;
    this.events = await SocietyGolfDB.getOrganizerEventsWithStats(organizerId);
    console.log(`⚡ Loaded ${this.events.length} events with stats in ${ms}ms`);
    this.renderEventsList();
}

Benefits:
- Single database call instead of multiple
- Parallel queries for maximum speed
- Stats pre-calculated and cached in event objects
- Performance logging for monitoring

SECTION 3: Enhanced Event Cards
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Lines: 30238-30432 (194 lines - completely rewritten)
Location: SocietyOrganizerManager.renderEventCard()

Major Changes:

1. Statistics Calculation (Lines 30285-30290):
   const stats = event.stats || { registered: 0, ... };
   const percentage = maxPlayers > 0 ?
     Math.round((registered / maxPlayers) * 100) : 0;
   const spotsRemaining = maxPlayers > 0 ?
     maxPlayers - registered : '∞';

2. Enhanced Status Logic (Lines 30292-30311):
   - Checks if event is full (registered >= maxPlayers)
   - Checks if past cutoff date
   - Three states: Full (orange), Closed (red), Open (green)
   - Font weight: semibold for better visibility

3. Dynamic Progress Bar (Lines 30313-30319):
   - Green: 0-89% full
   - Orange: 90-99% full
   - Red: 100%+ full (overflow handling)

4. New Statistics Section (Lines 30356-30390):
   HTML Structure:
   <div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-50 to-indigo-50">
     <!-- Registration count and percentage -->
     <!-- Progress bar -->
     <!-- Grid of statistics -->
   </div>

   - Edit (secondary button)
   - Export (secondary button) ← NEW!

✅ Better action organization

DATABASE QUERIES:

Before Phase 1:
1. Query: Get all events for organizer
   SELECT * FROM society_events WHERE organizer_id = ?

   Result: Basic event data only
   {
     id, name, date, maxPlayers, courseName, fees, etc.
   }

After Phase 1:
1. Query: Get all events for organizer
   SELECT * FROM society_events WHERE organizer_id = ?

2. Parallel Query A: Get registration data
   SELECT event_id, want_transport, want_competition, is_paid
   FROM event_registrations WHERE event_id IN (...)

3. Parallel Query B: Get waitlist data
   SELECT event_id FROM event_waitlist WHERE event_id IN (...)

   Result: Events with embedded stats
   {
     id, name, date, maxPlayers, courseName, fees, etc.,
     stats: {
       registered: 28,
       waitlist: 12,
       transportCount: 15,
       competitionCount: 22,
       paidCount: 20,
       revenue: 98000
     }
   }

Performance Impact:
- Query count: 1 → 1 + 2 parallel = ~1.5x queries
- Data richness: 10 fields → 10 fields + 6 stats = 16 total
- Page load: Single fast batch load
- User experience: Instant comprehensive view

CSV EXPORT:

Before Phase 1:
- Existed but limited to basic roster modal
- Manual navigation required (Events → Roster → Export)
- Basic fields only
- No event context in export

After Phase 1:

- Direct "Export" button
- Comprehensive data including payments
- Event information header
- Summary statistics row
- Professional filename with date

Export Quality:
Before: Name, Handicap, Transport, Competition
After: Name, Handicap, Transport, Competition, Paid,
       Payment Date, Registered Date, Partner Prefs,
       + Event header + Summary row
