      - Contact info
      - Special requests

  Known Issues / Notes

  1. society-organizer-manager.js file exists but is NOT loaded
    - All functionality is in inline class in index.html around line 28265
    - The separate file is outdated and should be ignored or deleted
  2. Realtime subscriptions implemented but not fully tested
    - Events should update live when changed by another user
    - May need testing with multiple concurrent users
  3. Profile logo stored as base64
    - Works but can be large for database
    - Consider moving to Supabase Storage in future for better performance
  4. RLS policies allow anonymous access
    - All CRUD operations allowed because LINE handles auth
    - Not using Supabase auth.jwt()
    - Security relies on LINE authentication layer
  5. No image optimization
    - Logos stored at uploaded size
    - Should add client-side resize before upload for better performance
