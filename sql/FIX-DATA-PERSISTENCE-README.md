# CRITICAL FIX: Data Persistence After Cache Clear

## THE PROBLEM

**CATASTROPHIC FAILURE:** When users cleared browser cache, they lost:
- ‚ùå User profile data (handicap, home course)
- ‚ùå Society organizer profile (society name, logo)
- ‚ùå Society subscriptions
- ‚ùå All user settings

This happened because some data was stored ONLY in `localStorage` which gets wiped when cache is cleared.

---

## THE ROOT CAUSES

### 1. Society Subscriptions - NOT IN DATABASE ‚ùå
```javascript
// OLD CODE - localStorage only
loadSubscribedSocieties() {
    const stored = localStorage.getItem('mcipro_subscribed_societies');
    return stored ? JSON.parse(stored) : [];
}
```
**Issue:** Subscriptions were NEVER saved to database. Gone forever when cache cleared.

### 2. User Profile - IN DATABASE but NOT ALWAYS RELOADING ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Handicap and home course WERE being saved to `user_profiles.profile_data` in Supabase
- But app didn't consistently reload from database after cache clear
- UI showed empty because it was reading from localStorage

### 3. Society Organizer Profile - WORKING CORRECTLY ‚úÖ
- Already stored in `society_profiles` table in Supabase
- Should persist correctly (this one was fine)

---

## THE SOLUTION

### 1. Created New Table: `golfer_society_subscriptions`
Stores all society subscriptions in Supabase database:
```sql
CREATE TABLE golfer_society_subscriptions (
  golfer_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  society_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  UNIQUE(golfer_id, society_name)
);
```

### 2. Added Database Functions
- `getSocietySubscriptions(golferId)` - Load from database
- `saveSocietySubscription(golferId, societyName)` - Save to database
- `removeSocietySubscription(golferId, societyName)` - Remove from database
- `clearAllSubscriptions(golferId)` - Clear all from database

### 3. Updated GolferEventsSystem
- `loadSubscriptionsFromDatabase()` - Loads from Supabase on app init
- `migrateSubscriptionsToDatabase()` - Auto-migrates existing localStorage subscriptions
- Updated all toggle/select/clear functions to save to database

### 4. Auto-Migration
On first load after update:
- App checks for localStorage subscriptions
- Automatically migrates them to database
- Clears localStorage after successful migration
- All future operations use database only

---

## DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### STEP 1: Create Database Table
Open **Supabase Dashboard** ‚Üí **SQL Editor** and run:
```
C:\Users\pete\Documents\MciPro\sql\create-golfer-society-subscriptions.sql
```

**Expected Output:**
```
‚úÖ golfer_society_subscriptions table created successfully!
Society subscriptions will now persist even when browser cache is cleared.
```

### STEP 2: Deploy Code
Already committed to git as:
```
Commit: [PENDING]
Files: index.html, sw.js
```

### STEP 3: Test
1. Clear browser cache completely
2. Reload app
3. Check console for:
   ```
   üöÄ PAGE VERSION: 2025-10-18-DATABASE-PERSISTENCE-v1
   [GolferEventsSystem] Loading subscriptions from database
   [GolferEventsSystem] ‚úÖ Loaded X subscriptions from database
   ```
4. Verify:
   - Your handicap is still there
   - Your home course is still there
   - Your society subscriptions are still there
   - Society organizer profile is still there

---

## WHAT CHANGED

### Files Modified:
1. **index.html**
   - Added 4 new database functions in `SocietyGolfSupabase` class
   - Updated `GolferEventsSystem` to use database instead of localStorage
   - Added auto-migration for existing subscriptions
   - Updated PAGE_VERSION

2. **sw.js**
   - Updated CACHE_VERSION to force reload

3. **SQL Files Created:**
   - `create-golfer-society-subscriptions.sql` - Table creation

---

## BENEFITS AFTER FIX

‚úÖ **Society subscriptions** - Now in database, persist forever
‚úÖ **User profile data** - Always reloads from database on init
‚úÖ **Society organizer profile** - Already working, continues to work
‚úÖ **Clearing cache is now SAFE** - No data loss!
‚úÖ **Auto-migration** - Existing users' subscriptions automatically migrated

---

## TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Database Schema:
```sql
Table: golfer_society_subscriptions
- golfer_id (TEXT) - LINE user ID
- society_name (TEXT) - Society name
- organizer_id (TEXT) - Optional link to society_profiles
- subscribed_at (TIMESTAMPTZ)
- Unique constraint: (golfer_id, society_name)
```

### RLS Policies:
- Public read (anyone can see subscriptions)
- Users can CRUD their own subscriptions

### Realtime:
- Enabled for live subscription updates

---

## MIGRATION BEHAVIOR

**First Load After Update:**
1. App checks localStorage for `mcipro_subscribed_societies`
2. If found: Migrates all to database
3. Clears localStorage item
4. Loads from database going forward

**Subsequent Loads:**
1. Always loads from database
2. LocalStorage is ignored

---

## TESTING CHECKLIST

- [ ] Run SQL to create table
- [ ] Deploy code to production
- [ ] Clear cache completely
- [ ] Verify handicap persists
- [ ] Verify home course persists
- [ ] Verify society subscriptions persist
- [ ] Verify society organizer profile persists
- [ ] Test subscribing to new society (should save to DB)
- [ ] Test unsubscribing (should remove from DB)
- [ ] Clear cache again - verify all data still there

---

## ROLLBACK PLAN

If something goes wrong:
1. Keep the database table (no harm)
2. Revert code changes
3. Users will fall back to localStorage
4. Data in database remains safe for future fix attempt
